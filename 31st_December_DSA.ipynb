    "Step 1: Find the middle of the linked list<br>\n",
    "To find the middle of the linked list, we can use the two-pointer technique. We initialize two pointers, slow and fast, both pointing to the head of the linked list.

We maintain three pointers: prev, curr, and next. We start with prev and curr pointing to None and the head of the second half, respectively. We iterate through the second half, updating the next pointer of the current node to point to the previous node (prev), and then move prev and curr one step forward.<br>\n",

We iterate through both halves, comparing the values of the nodes. If at any point the values are not equal, we can conclude that the linked list is not a palindrome.
